To achieve this we will develop and disseminate new and improved computational models of the mucosal immune system to generate new knowledge from immunology and infectious disease datasets. Our targeted pathogens are Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Helicobacter pylori, but the simulations can be extended to other enteric pathogens. MIEP will engage in hypothesis-driven and modeling-based, hypothesis-generating research related to mucosal immunity to enteric pathogens that addresses immune mechanisms of action, validation and refinement in animal models and human clinical specimens. The scientific goals are to build, refine and validate predictive, multiscale, user-friendly models of the gut mucosal immune system that compute condition-based interactions between cells, and to test the validity of simulation-derived hypotheses in vitro, ex vivo, in animal models and using human clinical specimens.  A web portal will allow access to our modeling and simulation tools as well as enteric pathogen and immunological data, including tutorials and webinars. Summer school programs and symposia related to modeling immunity to enteric pathogens will extend the outreach of this effort.  The accelerated infectious disease research and discovery facilitated by MIEP will drive a rational development of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutics, and help to prevent food-borne and diarrheal illness. The modeling tools developed for this effort will be freely available for use by other immunological researchers via the internet, to increase knowledge of host immune responses to other pathogens, and the database, community interface and training provided by MIEP will advance research and fuel future collaborations in this vital area of biodefense.   https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=0d5af255f79c0573bb82c2698451bc86&tab=core&_cview=1"

  "description": "The development of gastritis during Helicobacter pylori infection is dependent on an activated adaptive immune response orchestrated by T helper cells. The relative contributions of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) subsets to gastritis and control of infection are still under investigation. Expression of IL-21, which may be produced by a number of T cell subsets, has been reported to increase during H. pylori infection. To investigate the role of IL-21 in the gastric mucosa during H. pylori infection, we combined mathematical modeling of CD4+ T cell differentiation with in vivo studies to elucidate the impact of IL-21 on H. pylori infection. Our computational modeling efforts predict that IL-21 activates the production of IFN gamma and IL17, the expression of Tbet and RORgamma t, the phosphorylation of STAT3, and suggest a potential role of IL-21 in the modulation of IL-10. To elucidate the role IL-21 in vivo, we infected IL-21 deficient mice and wild-type littermates with H. pylori strain SS1, and assessed colonization, gastric inflammation, cellular infiltration, and cytokine profiles in the gastric tissue."
