Although our focus is on understanding the population genetics of AVA response, the study will reveal fundamental knowledge about vaccines and the immune system that could ultimately improve many aspects of human health.The PopGen team recruited 1400+ volunteers to participate in an AVA trial, in which volunteers received the vaccine (or a non-vaccine control) and donated samples for genotyping and immunological measurements.In parallel, UAB PopGen commissioned SeattleSNPs at the University of Washington in Seattle to re-sequence a set of around 72 immune system-related candidate genes in forty individuals of European- or African-American background. This yielded allele frequency data for around 4323 SNPs, of which around half appear to be novel.

Medium throughput genotyping for SNP markers in a relatively few selected candidate genes whose specific forms of duplications or sequence variation resist typing with the BeadArrayTM approach will be performed by Pyrosequencing technology. We have successfully developed and performed numerous SNP assays with Pyrosequencing and have determined several thousand genotypes using this technique.  Genes included in these studies included the classical Fc receptor genes including FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR3A and FCGR3B.  These genes are known to be important in regulating Ab responses, and they are found on chromosome 1 in a region of segmental duplication. Because these genes/SNPs are refractory to the high throughput Illumina iSelect chemistry, Pyrosequencing with nested-PCR based amplification strategy was chosen to ensure gene specific amplification followed by the genotyping reaction on the gene-specific amplicon.",
