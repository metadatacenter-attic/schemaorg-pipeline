Four aims are proposed to meet this goal: Aim 1: To establish the baseline immune profiles in healthy subjects. Aim 2: To establish the immune profiles of Flu vaccination in healthy subjects. Aim 3: To identify the molecular signatures of DC subset(s) in response to Flu vaccination. Aim 4: To identify the molecular signatures of activated monocytes in response to Flu vaccination. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Despite the success of vaccines, we understand little about how effective ones stimulate protective immune responses. We will study how the flu vaccine generates effective antibody responses. The goal is to identify the immune responses elicited by effective vaccines so that vaccines that aren't as effective can be improved. To do this, we will vaccinate healthy people with the flu vaccine and monitor their immune response following the vaccination.   http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8691692&icde=23828587&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=3&csb=default&cs=ASC"

  "description": "The described experiments in this study were designed to deconvolute the molecular signature observed in the whole blood of healthy subsets at early time points following the administration of Fluzone 2010-2011 vaccines. RNA-seq data generated from sorted purified cell populations, including mDC and monocyte subsets will permit us to reveal distinct roles that DC and monocyte subsets play in eliciting immune responses to vaccines against flu in healthy adults using system biology approaches."
