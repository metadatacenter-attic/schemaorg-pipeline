  "description": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20, Rituxan, MabThera) in individuals who develop new anti-HLA antibodies after renal (kidney) transplant will promote longer-term survival of the transplanted kidney. The pilot study compares the use of rituximab (Rituxan) + site-specific standard immunosuppression to placebo + site-specific standard immunosuppression in the treatment of circulating anti-HLA antibodies in subjects who develop de novo anti-HLA antibodies between 3-36 months after transplant."
