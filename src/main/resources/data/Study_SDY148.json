To achieve this we will develop and disseminate new and improved computational models of the mucosal immune system to generate new knowledge from immunology and infectious disease datasets. Our targeted pathogens are Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Helicobacter pylori, but the simulations can be extended to other enteric pathogens. MIEP will engage in hypothesis-driven and modeling-based, hypothesis-generating research related to mucosal immunity to enteric pathogens that addresses immune mechanisms of action, validation and refinement in animal models and human clinical specimens. The scientific goals are to build, refine and validate predictive, multiscale, user-friendly models of the gut mucosal immune system that compute condition-based interactions between cells, and to test the validity of simulation-derived hypotheses in vitro, ex vivo, in animal models and using human clinical specimens.  A web portal will allow access to our modeling and simulation tools as well as enteric pathogen and immunological data, including tutorials and webinars. Summer school programs and symposia related to modeling immunity to enteric pathogens will extend the outreach of this effort.  The accelerated infectious disease research and discovery facilitated by MIEP will drive a rational development of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutics, and help to prevent food-borne and diarrheal illness. The modeling tools developed for this effort will be freely available for use by other immunological researchers via the internet, to increase knowledge of host immune responses to other pathogens, and the database, community interface and training provided by MIEP will advance research and fuel future collaborations in this vital area of biodefense.   https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=0d5af255f79c0573bb82c2698451bc86&tab=core&_cview=1"

  "description": "Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is recognized as an emerging cause of persistent diarrhea and enteric disease worldwide. Mucosal immunity towards EAEC infections is incompletely understood;due in part to the lack of appropriate animal models. This study presents a new mouse model and investigates the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) in the modulation of host responses to EAEC in nourished and malnourished mice. Methods/Principal Findings: Wild-type and T cell-specific PPARg null C57BL/6 mice were fed protein-deficient diets at weaning and challenged with 5x10^9 cfu EAEC strain JM221 to measure colonic gene expression and immune responses to EAEC. Antigen-specific responses to E. coli antigens were measured in nourished and malnourished mice following infection and demonstrated the immunosuppressive effects of malnutrition at the cellular level. At the molecular level, both pharmacological blockade and deletion of PPARg in T cells resulted in upregulation of Tgfb1, IL-6, IL-17 and anti-microbial peptides, enhanced Th17 responses, fewer colonic lesions, faster clearance of EAEC, and improved recovery. The beneficial effects of PPAR gamma blockade on weight loss and EAEC clearance were abrogated by neutralizing IL-17 in vivo. Conclusions: Our studies provide in vivo evidence in support of supporting the beneficial role of mucosal innate and effector T cell responses on the EAEC burden and suggest pharmacological blockade of PPARg as a novel therapeutic intervention for EAEC infection.
