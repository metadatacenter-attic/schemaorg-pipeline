To achieve this we will develop and disseminate new and improved computational models of the mucosal immune system to generate new knowledge from immunology and infectious disease datasets. Our targeted pathogens are Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Helicobacter pylori, but the simulations can be extended to other enteric pathogens. MIEP will engage in hypothesis-driven and modeling-based, hypothesis-generating research related to mucosal immunity to enteric pathogens that addresses immune mechanisms of action, validation and refinement in animal models and human clinical specimens. The scientific goals are to build, refine and validate predictive, multiscale, user-friendly models of the gut mucosal immune system that compute condition-based interactions between cells, and to test the validity of simulation-derived hypotheses in vitro, ex vivo, in animal models and using human clinical specimens.  A web portal will allow access to our modeling and simulation tools as well as enteric pathogen and immunological data, including tutorials and webinars. Summer school programs and symposia related to modeling immunity to enteric pathogens will extend the outreach of this effort.  The accelerated infectious disease research and discovery facilitated by MIEP will drive a rational development of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutics, and help to prevent food-borne and diarrheal illness. The modeling tools developed for this effort will be freely available for use by other immunological researchers via the internet, to increase knowledge of host immune responses to other pathogens, and the database, community interface and training provided by MIEP will advance research and fuel future collaborations in this vital area of biodefense.   https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=0d5af255f79c0573bb82c2698451bc86&tab=core&_cview=1"

  "description": " Differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector or regulatory phenotypes is tightly controlled by the cytokine milieu, complex intracellular signaling networks and numerous transcriptional regulators. We combined experimental approaches and computational modeling to investigate the mechanisms controlling differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells in the gut of mice. Our computational model encompasses the major intracellular pathways involved in CD4+ T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg). Our modeling efforts predicted a critical role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) in modulating plasticity between Th17 and iTreg cells. PPARg regulates differentiation, activation and cytokine production, thereby controlling the induction of effector and regulatory responses, and is a promising therapeutic target for dysregulated immune responses and inflammation. Our modeling efforts predict that following PPARg activation, Th17 cells undergo phenotype switch and become iTreg cells. This prediction was validated by results of adoptive transfer studies showing an increase of colonic iTreg and a decrease of Th17 cells in the gut mucosa of mice with colitis following pharmacological activation of PPARg. Deletion of PPARg in CD4+ T cells impaired mucosal iTreg and enhanced colitogenic Th17 responses in mice with CD4+ T cell-induced colitis. Thus, for the first time we provide novel molecular evidence in vivo demonstrating that PPARg in addition to regulating CD4+ T cell differentiation also plays a major role controlling Th17 and iTreg plasticity in the gut mucosa."
