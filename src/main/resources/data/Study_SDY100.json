To achieve this we will develop and disseminate new and improved computational models of the mucosal immune system to generate new knowledge from immunology and infectious disease datasets. Our targeted pathogens are Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Helicobacter pylori, but the simulations can be extended to other enteric pathogens. MIEP will engage in hypothesis-driven and modeling-based, hypothesis-generating research related to mucosal immunity to enteric pathogens that addresses immune mechanisms of action, validation and refinement in animal models and human clinical specimens. The scientific goals are to build, refine and validate predictive, multiscale, user-friendly models of the gut mucosal immune system that compute condition-based interactions between cells, and to test the validity of simulation-derived hypotheses in vitro, ex vivo, in animal models and using human clinical specimens.  A web portal will allow access to our modeling and simulation tools as well as enteric pathogen and immunological data, including tutorials and webinars. Summer school programs and symposia related to modeling immunity to enteric pathogens will extend the outreach of this effort.  The accelerated infectious disease research and discovery facilitated by MIEP will drive a rational development of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutics, and help to prevent food-borne and diarrheal illness. The modeling tools developed for this effort will be freely available for use by other immunological researchers via the internet, to increase knowledge of host immune responses to other pathogens, and the database, community interface and training provided by MIEP will advance research and fuel future collaborations in this vital area of biodefense.   https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=0d5af255f79c0573bb82c2698451bc86&tab=core&_cview=1"

  "description": "Clostridium difficile is typically a harmless anaerobic bacterium but recently it has re-emerged as a facultative pathogen that can cause nosocomial diarrhea, colitis and even death. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)  gamma has been implicated in the prevention of inflammation in autoimmune and infectious diseases; however, its role in the immunoregulatory mechanisms modulating host responses to C. difficile remains largely unknown. To characterize the role of PPAR gamma in C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD), immunity and gut pathology, we used a mouse model of C. difficile infection in wild-type and T cell-specific PPAR gamma null mice. The loss of PPAR gamma in T cells increased disease activity and colonic inflammatory lesions following C. difficile infection. Colonic expression of IL-17 was upregulated and IL-10 downregulated in colons of T cell-specific PPAR gamma null mice. Also, both the loss of PPAR gamma in T cells and C. difficile infection favored Th17 responses in spleen and colonic lamina propria of mice with CDAD. MicroRNA (miRNA)-sequencing analysis and RT-PCR validation indicated that miR-146b was significantly overexpressed in colons of C. difficile-infected mice. We next developed a computational model that predicts the upregulation of miR-146b, downregulation of the PPAR gamma co-activator NCOA4, and PPAR gamma, leading to upregulation of IL-17. Treatment of C. difficile-infected mice with the PPAR gamma agonist pioglitazone ameliorated colitis and suppressed pro-inflammatory gene expression. In conclusion, our data indicates that miRNA-146b and PPAR gamma may be implicated in the regulation of Th17 responses and colitis in C. difficile-infected mice."
