  "description": "Patients who have been diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) often develop problems related to the central nervous system, which controls the nerves in the body. Some of these patients may later be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), a progressive disease of the nervous system. The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug atorvastatin is helpful to CIS patients. Study hypothesis: Early intervention with atorvastatin in patients with CIS will result in a state of immunological tolerance."
