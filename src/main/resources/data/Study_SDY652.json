This research program seeks to identify the factors and mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility to infection from or limit vaccine efficacy against potential bioterrorism agents and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases in immunocompromised populations, including neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. The continued threat of bioterrorism and greater worldwide spread of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases underscore the need for vaccines and immune-based therapeutics that can protect the entire population. For example, the number of the most vulnerable individuals, in terms of immune status, is increasing. More effective and better tolerated vaccines and immunotherapies are required for these immunocompromised populations. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of immune compromise, and to provide the foundation for the development of novel interventions.  For this initiative, special populations are defined as neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women the elderly, and individuals who are receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. All of these populations are referred to as ?immunocompromised' throughout the solicitation.
