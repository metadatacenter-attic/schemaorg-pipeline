This research program seeks to identify the factors and mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility to infection from or limit vaccine efficacy against potential bioterrorism agents and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases in immunocompromised populations, including neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. The continued threat of bioterrorism and greater worldwide spread of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases underscore the need for vaccines and immune-based therapeutics that can protect the entire population. For example, the number of the most vulnerable individuals, in terms of immune status, is increasing. More effective and better tolerated vaccines and immunotherapies are required for these immunocompromised populations. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of immune compromise, and to provide the foundation for the development of novel interventions.  For this initiative, special populations are defined as neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women the elderly, and individuals who are receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. All of these populations are referred to as ?immunocompromised' throughout the solicitation.

  "description": "In a mouse model of age-related vulnerability to WNV, we demonstrate that death correlates with increased viral titers in the brain and that this loss of virus control with age was the result of defects in the CD4 and CD8 T cell response against WNV. Specific age-related defects in T cell responses against dominant WNV epitopes were detected at the level of cytokine and lytic granule production, each of which are essential for resistance against WNV, and in the ability to generate multifunctional anti-WNV effector T cells, which are believed to be critical for robust antiviral immunity. In contrast, at the peak of the response, old and adult T cells exhibited superimposable peptide sensitivity. Most importantly, although the adult CD4 or CD8 T cells readily protected immunodeficient mice upon adoptive transfer, old T cells of either subset were unable to provide WNV-specific protection. Consistent with a profound qualitative and quantitative defect in T cell immunity, old brains contained at least 12x fewer total effector CD8 T cells compared with adult mice at the peak of brain infection. These findings identify potential targets for immunomodulation and treatment to combat lethal WNV infection in the elderly"
