In the event of such an attack, immunocompromised patients who prominently include autoimmune patients subject to therapeutic immunosuppression will be at a high risk. Therefore, there is a need to identify the specific immune defects that make these populations especially vulnerable. One of the more prevalent forms of immunosuppression used for a growing number of autoimmune conditions is chronic blockade of Tumor Necrosis Factor ??A? (TNF). It is expected that in the near future candidates for this type of therapy will include several million American citizens. The University of Rochester Program for Biodefense of Immunocompromised Populations will undertake the systematic study of human immune function with the goal of identifying defective mechanisms of immune response in patients treated with TNF??A? blockade (anti-TNF). Although our study will not be specifically designed to understand immune function in the elderly, the inclusion of a subset of patients and controls over and under age 50 may result in the discovery of age-specific defects. The Rochester Program will identify immune defects secondary to the use of anti-TNF therapies through a comprehensive series of studies of immune homeostasis and function, including the study of B-cell function in patients treated with anti-TNF, the study of T-cell function in patients treated with anti-TNF, the study of dendritic cell function in patients treated with anti-TNF, the development of a 3D bioreactor system for the study of human immune function. In addition we will build a discrete event stochastic simulator of B cell activation and differentiation. This in silico model will be used to formulate and test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of anti-TNF effects. A Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will assist in experimental design and have responsibility for the electronic storage and statistical analysis of all clinical and experimental data. Our results will be disseminated on a timely basis by a multi-prong approach that includes a web-based data sharing system, publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals, presentation in scientific meetings and participation in annual program meetings"
