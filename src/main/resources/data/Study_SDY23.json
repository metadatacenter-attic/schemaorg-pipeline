        "description": "The GoldenGate Assay allows for a high degree of loci multiplexing during the extension and amplification steps.  The DNA sample used in this assay is activated for binding to paramagnetic particles. Assay oligonucleotides, hybridization buffer, and paramagnetic particles are then combined with the activated DNA in the hybridization step.  Three oligonucleotides are designed for each SNP locus. Two oligos are specific to each allele of the SNP site, called the Allele-Specific Oligos (ASOs). A third oligo that hybridizes several bases downstream from the SNP site is the Locus-Specific Oligo (LSO). All three oligonucleotide sequences contain regions of genomic complementarity and universal PCR primer sites; the LSO also contains a unique address sequence that targets a particular bead type. Up to 1,536 SNPs may be interrogated simultaneously in this manner using GoldenGate technology. During the primer hybridization process, the assay oligonucleotides hybridize to the genomic DNA sample bound to paramagnetic particles.  Following hybridization, several wash steps are performed, reducing noise by removing excess and mis-hybridized oligonucleotides. Extension of the appropriate ASO and ligation of the extended product to the LSO joins information about the genotype present at the SNP site to the address sequence on the LSO. These joined, fulllength products provide a template for PCR using universal PCR primers P1, P2, and P3.  Universal PCR primers P1 and P2 are Cy3- and Cy5-labeled. After downstream-processing the single-stranded, dye-labeled DNAs are hybridized to their complement bead type through their unique address sequences. Hybridization of the GoldenGate Assay products onto the Array Matrix or BeadChip allows for the separation of the assay products in solution, onto a solid surface for individual SNP genotype readout. After hybridization, the BeadArray Reader is used to analyze fluorescence signal on the Sentrix Array Matrix or BeadChip, which is in turn analyzed using software for automated genotype clustering and calling provided by Illumina.

  "description": "Innate immunity gene products are known to be the first-line of host-defense and to control and assist the adaptive immune system. This research represents the opportunity to study, in detail, the responses longitudinally to vaccination (using clinical examination and laboratory assays) in a large ethnic population. Consequently, a prioritized set of genes and gene products from both systems will be evaluated."
