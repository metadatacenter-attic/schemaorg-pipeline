This research program seeks to identify the factors and mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility to infection from or limit vaccine efficacy against potential bioterrorism agents and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases in immunocompromised populations, including neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. The continued threat of bioterrorism and greater worldwide spread of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases underscore the need for vaccines and immune-based therapeutics that can protect the entire population. For example, the number of the most vulnerable individuals, in terms of immune status, is increasing. More effective and better tolerated vaccines and immunotherapies are required for these immunocompromised populations. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of immune compromise, and to provide the foundation for the development of novel interventions.  For this initiative, special populations are defined as neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women the elderly, and individuals who are receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. All of these populations are referred to as ?immunocompromised' throughout the solicitation.

  "description": "Aging leads to dysregulation of multiple components of the immune system that result in increased susceptibility to infections and poor response to vaccines in the aging population. The dysfunctions of adaptive B and T cells are well documented but the effect of aging on innate immunity remains incompletely understood. Using a heterogeneous population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we first undertook transcriptional profiling and found that PBMCs isolated from old individuals (>= 65 yrs) exhibited a delayed and altered response to stimulation with TLR4, TLR7/8, and RIG-I agonists compared to cells obtained from adults (<= 40 yrs). This delayed response to innate immune agonists resulted in the reduced production of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines including TNFa, IL-6, IL-1b, IFNg, IFNa, CCL2 and CCL7. While the major monocyte and dendritic cell subsets did not change numerically with aging, activation of specific cell types was altered. PBMCs from old subjects also had a lower frequency of CD40+ monocytes, impaired up-regulation of PD-L1 on monocytes and T cells and increased expression of PD-L2 and B7-H4 on B cells. The defective immune response to innate agonists adversely affected adaptive immunity as TLR-stimulated PBMCs (minus CD3 T cells) from old subjects elicited significantly lower levels of adult T cell proliferation than those from adult subjects in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Collectively, these age-associated changes in cytokine, chemokine and interferon production, as well as co-stimulatory protein expression could contribute to the blunted memory B and T cell immune responses to vaccines and infections."
